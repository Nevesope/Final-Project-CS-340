# Final-Project-CS-340

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

For this Project in specific, it was very efficient to begin with the base layer of this project first. I was able to work closely with the database first and then move forward. Connecting the two portions of the project was challenging but once completed it was clear. the biggest thing I focus on when writing maintainable code is to re-read everthing I type and make sure to run the program constantly. This CRUD module will be a good reference me in the future. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

My favorite technique is to follow closely the agile metholodgy. I like the concept of creating a plan, heading into design, develop, and the test and review. I think this flow is benefical for cathcing errors and even things that maybe clients want changed. This project was one of the heaviest projects I've had so far, so I apporached this project slowly and made sure I had multiple days throughout the week to test and run information. In the future I will probably focus on being more organized for the clients needs.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists are there to build and create things that can hopefully advance our society. We are mean't to create things from the range of efficiency to entertainment. I think the best way to help a company like this is to make sure that the problems and questions can be easily fixed from the workers. And make the app user friendly and effecient for the people in search of something.
